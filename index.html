  <h1>Hey there, got a question for me? Just ask away!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a big believer in the idea that the best way to learn is to ask questions. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold">I'm always happy
    to help out, and I'll do my best to answer any questions you have.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes, people can get a bit caught up in just asking the question, as they're used to other
    mediums like email or phone. In modern chat apps though, it's easier for everyone if you just
    ask away!
  </p>
  <article>
    <header>✅ Just ask away!</header>
    <blockquote>
      Hey there, can you show me how to set up X on Y when you get a spare second?
    </blockquote>
    This saves time for everyone, and lets the person you're asking decide if they have the time to
    answer.<br/>
    Bonus points if you can include a link or an example of what you're trying to do, or need help with!

    <header>❌ Don't ask for permission to ask a question</header>
    <blockquote>
      Hey there, do you mind if I ask you a quick question?
    </blockquote>
    This might seem like a more polite way to ask, but in practice, it's usually either redundant or puts pressure on the other person to say yes.<br/>
    If you're worried about interrupting someone, just ask the question and let them decide if they have time to answer.

    <header>❌ Don't say hi and then write the question after</header>
    <blockquote>
      [10:42 AM] A: Hey, how are you going?<br/>
      [10:42 AM] B: Good thanks, how can I help you?<br/>
      [10:44 AM] A: I'm trying to set up X on Y, but I'm having trouble with Z. Can you help?
    </blockquote>
    Manners are great, but in this case, it'll be easier for everyone if you just ask the question up front.<br/>
    As a compromise, you could say hi and then ask the question in the same message - that way, the other person has all the information they need to answer when they get a notification.
