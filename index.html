  <h1>Hey there, got a question for me? Just ask away!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a big believer in the idea that the best way to learn is to ask questions. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold">I'm always happy
    to help out, and I'll do my best to answer any questions you have.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes, people can get a bit caught up in just asking the question, as they're used to other
    mediums like email or phone. In modern chat apps though, it's easier for everyone if you just
    ask away!
  </p>
  <article>
    <header>✅ Just ask away!</header>
    <blockquote>
      Hey there, can you show me how to set up X on Y when you get a spare second?
    </blockquote>
    This saves time for everyone, and lets the person you're asking decide if they have the time to
    answer.<br/>
    Bonus points if you can include a link or an example of what you're trying to do, or need help with!

  <article>
    <header>❌ Don't ask for permission to ask a question</header>
    <blockquote>
      Hey there, do you mind if I ask you a quick question?
    </blockquote>
    This doesn't really achieve anything, and forces the other person to agree to help you before
    they know what you want.

    <header>❌ Don't say hi and then write the question after</header>
    <blockquote>
      [10:42 AM] A: Hey, how are you going?<br/>
      [10:42 AM] B: Good thanks, how can I help you?<br/>
      [10:44 AM] A: I'm trying to set up X on Y, but I'm having trouble with Z. Can you help?
    </blockquote>
    This takes the other person's attention away from what they're doing, and forces them to wait
    for you to ask your question.
